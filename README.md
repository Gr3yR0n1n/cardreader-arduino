# cardreader-arduino
This sample leverages the Arduino Uno to read badge scans from HID Prox ProxPoint Plus.
For this code, I set the Green (Data) to pin 2, and the White (Clock) to pin 3.

This code works using the "Clock and Data" protocol as described here: http://emssa.net/source/images/new_pdf/appnote_2.pdf

Please let me know if you find improvements that can be made to this sample.
